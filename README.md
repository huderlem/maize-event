This is the source code for the now-defunct Pokémon Maize Event Giveaway website. It was hosted on the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) platform.  [Pokémon Maize](https://github.com/huderlem/maize) is my old ROM hack of Pokémon Red Version, and it had an in-game system where the player could enter a code to receive special Pokémon.  First, the player would enter his/her trainer id into the website, and it would generate a code to be used in-game. Pokémon Maize also supported shiny Pokémon, so this event could generate shiny Pokémon for the player.

There are four alternate sprites for special Pokémon which could only be received via this event website:
1. Electrode with a headband

2. Squirtle with sunglasses

I believe I only ever had the event run for the Squirtle with sunglasses, and a shiny Pikachu (which was meant to be a "Pikablu").
